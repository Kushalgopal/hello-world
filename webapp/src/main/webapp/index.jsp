<h1> Hello, Welcome to CI/CD pipeline!   </h1>
<h2> Deploying on a Tomcat server using ansible is successfull </h2>
<h2> The second commit works! </h2>
<h2> The third commit works as well! Code is pulled from Git repo whenever changes are made </h3>
<h2> The build is set now for * * * * * which is every minute, every hour, every day, every month, every year </h2>
<h2> This confirms that Jenkins builds and deploys the war file only when changes are made to the code in the git repo </h2>
<h2> Glad to see you here </h2>
